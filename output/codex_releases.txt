## [0.3.0](https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/tag/rust-v0.3.0)

This addresses a number of important issues reported in 0.2.0
- Fixes an issue where non-ASCII characters were crashing the CLI: (huge thanks to [@ryozi-tn](https://github.com/ryozi-tn) for the fix)
- Adds support for a `--sandbox` flag and makes some breaking changes to `config.toml` around this option. 
- Makes it possible to configure custom HTTP headers when making requests to model providers

============================================================

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/tag/rust-v0.4.0)

* Honor the `OPENAI_BASE_URL ` environment variable for the built-in `openai` model provider
* Support `model_reasoning_effort` and `model_reasoning_summary` when defining a profile 
* Add a `completion` subcommand to the CLI so we can ultimately add `generate_completions_from_executable` to our Homebrew formula: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/main/Formula/c/codex.rb

============================================================

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/tag/rust-v0.5.0)

* Added new config option: `model_supports_reasoning_summaries`
* Thanks to [@reneleonhardt](https://github.com/reneleonhardt) for helping update a number of our dependencies (we now build with Rust 1.88!)
* Removed reference to `/compact` because it is not supported yet
* Thanks to [@pchuri](https://github.com/pchuri) so that when running Codex installed via `npm`, `process.platform === "android"` will run the Rust CLI
* Fix generated shell completions to use the name `codex` instead of `codex-cli`

============================================================

## [0.6.0](https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/tag/rust-v0.6.0)

* `id` for notifications associated with a `codex` tool call now match the request id
* Paste summarization for large pastes
* Experimental `codex apply` command to interact with Codex Web

============================================================

## [0.7.0](https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/tag/rust-v0.7.0)

Need to publish a new version on npm.

============================================================

## [0.8.0](https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/tag/rust-v0.8.0)

- we now stream the response from the model in the TUI and when using `codex exec`
- changes `ctrl-d` so it only exits the TUI if the composer is empty (it will still exit the TUI if the composer is hidden because the Codex agent is thinking)
- As a heads up, changes the organization of the `~/.codex/sessions` folder so it has `YYYY/MM/DD` subfolders. This should make it easier to find recent sessions and avoid degrading filesystem performance because previously `~/.codex/sessions` could end up with an unbounded number of entries
- fixes a longstanding issue where we failed to handle long MCP tool names gracefully (was the relevant GitHub issue)
- introduced a `--json` flag to `codex exec` so that it prints output as JSONL to stdout
- tries to ensure that when the Codex CLI is launched via the Node.js script in the `npm` version that both the Codex CLI process and Node.js process exit together, though it seems like it is not sufficient to fix that specific problem.
- Though it should make it so that, on Windows, the `npm` version will fall back to the TypeScript version (for now) rather than just crashing

============================================================

## [0.36.0](https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/tag/rust-v0.36.0)

### **Breaking change:** `OPENAI_API_KEY` is no longer read from the environment

API login is no longer implicit; we do not pick up `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the environment. To use an API key programmatically, run the following _once_
```shell
codex login --api-key "your-api-key-here"
```

and this value will be stored in `CODEX_HOME/auth.json`.

The next time you run `codex`, the API key stored in `auth.json` will be used automatically.

To switch to ChatGPT login instead of using your API key, run `codex login`.

Note that `codex logout` will remove whatever login credential is stored in `auth.json` (API key or ChatGPT auth token).

### Highlights

**Introducing our newest model GPT-5-Codex**
GPT-5-Codex works faster through easy tasks and harder on complex tasks, improves on code quality, and is more steerable with AGENTS.md. [Learn More](https://openai.com/index/introducing-upgrades-to-codex/)
 
**Resuming old sessions** 
Resuming old conversations with `codex resume` (,).

**Unified execution and reliability**
Unified execution improvements (,) and race-condition fix; include command output on timeouts; do not execute when command parses as a patch; improved sandbox timeout handling; flaky test fixes (,).

**Auth and login experience**
- login polish; fix issue allowing to be both logged in and using API key simultaneously; fix stray login URL characters; fix `get_auth_status` for custom providers.

**JSON-RPC and MCP**
JSON-RPC: `SetDefaultModel` and `None` clears default (,), `UserInfo`, `reasoning_effort` in `NewConversationResponse`; initial MCP interface and docs (, ,); standardized shell description.

**TUI onboarding and polish**
New onboarding flow and animation (, , ,), consistent headers on resume (,), improved spacing/padding (, , ,), clearer interruption and status styling, numerous UX nits addressed (,).

**Core platform**
Experimental automatic context compaction; expanded default sandbox; Azure Responses API workaround; preserve more item IDs in Azure; logging and clippy improvements (,); `just test` via nextest.

### Improved MCP support
We are in the middle of significantly improving support for connecting to MCP servers including support for streamable http servers with optional bearer token or oauth login support.

Enable the `experimental_use_rmcp_client = true` flag in `config.toml` to use the new MCP stack. If you encounter issues, create a GitHub issue and add the `mcp` label. We would like to remove the experimental flag soon and will continue to expand MCP support over time.

============================================================

## [0.64.0](https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/tag/rust-v0.64.0)

## Features

 - Threads and turns now include git info, current working directory, CLI version, source metadata, and propagate thread and turn IDs on every item and error. They emit new notifications for diffs, plan updates, token-usage changes, and compaction events. File-change items provide output deltas, and ImageView items render images inline.
 - Review flow is enhanced with a detached review mode, explicit enter and exit events, review thread IDs, and review history remains visible after rollout filtering changes.
 - Execution gains an experimental “exp” model, unified exec pruning to limit session bloat, per-run custom environment injection, policy-approved command bypass, and Windows protections that flag risky browser or URL launches. History lookup now works on Windows and WSL, and model selection honors use_model.
 - Safety defaults improve via consolidated world-writable scanning and workspace-write enforcement of read-only .git directories. Sandbox assessment and approval flows align with trust policies.
 - MCP and shell tooling add shell-tool MCP login support, explicit capability declaration, sandbox awareness, publication to npm, and MCP elicitations. The rmcp client is upgraded to 0.10.0 for modern notifications.
 - Observability increases as command items expose process IDs and threads and turns emit token-usage and compaction events. Feedback metadata captures source information.
 - Tooling and ops gain follow-up v2 in the app-server test client, new config management utilities, and refreshed approvals documentation and quickstart placement.

 ## Bug fixes

 - PowerShell apply_patch parsing is corrected, and apply_patch tests now cover shell_command behavior.
 - Sandbox assessment regression is fixed, policy-approved commands are honored, dangerous-command checks are tightened on Windows, and workspace-write enforces .git read-only.
 - MCP startup tolerates missing type fields, stream error messages are clarified, and rmcp nix output hash issues are resolved.
 - Delegate cancellation no longer hangs unified exec, early-exit sessions are cleaned up, and duplicate “waited” renderings are suppressed.
 - recent_commits with limit zero now returns zero, and the NetBSD process-hardening build is unblocked.
 - Review rollout filtering is disabled so history shows, approval presets respect workspace-write, /approvals trust detection is corrected, and sandbox command assessment edge cases are fixed.
 - Compaction accounts for encrypted reasoning, handles token budgets accurately, and emits reliable token-usage and compaction events.
 - TTY stdin is required, WSL clipboard paths are normalized, and stale conversations are dropped on /new to avoid conflicts.
 - Custom prompt expansion with large pastes is fixed, example-config mistakes are corrected, and relative links and streamable_shell references are cleaned up. Upgrade messaging is corrected.
 - Windows sandbox treats <workspace_root>/.git as read-only, and risky browser launches are flagged before execution.
 - CLA allowlist now includes dependabot variants, and enterprises can skip upgrade checks and messages.
 - Flaky tests are stabilized, session recycling is improved, and rollout session initialization surfaces errors for diagnosis.

 ## Maintenance

 - Security and CI add cargo-audit and cargo-deny. GitHub Actions are updated to checkout v6 and upload-artifact v5. macOS 13 builds are dropped. A flaky Ubuntu variant is skipped. The next_minor_version script now resets the patch number correctly.
 - Dependencies are updated: libc 0.2.177, webbrowser 1.0.6, regex 1.12.2, toml_edit 0.23.5, arboard 3.6.1, serde_with 3.16.1, image 0.25.9, reqwest 0.12.24, tracing 0.1.43, and rmcp 0.10.0.
 - Documentation is refreshed: approvals and config guidance, codex max and xhigh defaults, example-config fixes, CLA guidance, and removal of streamable_shell references.
